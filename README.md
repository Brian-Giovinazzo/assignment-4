# Assignment 4: Read and understand Assembly code

- In this assignment, you will have as reference one C program called **arithmetic_sum.c** and its corresponding object file
  - **arithmetic_sum.c** declares and initializes five variables and calculate the sum of these variables. 
  - Its corresponding object file is called **arithmetic_sum.o**. 
- We are given four mysterious object codes: **one.o**, **two.o**, **three.o**, and 
**four.o** (stored inside the `test` folder).
  - **one.o** is generated from **one.c**.
  - **two.o** is generated from **two.c**. 
  - **three.o** is generated from **three.c**,
  - **four.o** is generated from **four.c**.
  - The syntax structures of **one.c**, **two.c**, **three.c**, and **four.c** are **extremely similar** to **arithmetic_sum.c**. 

Your task is to recreated **one.c**, **two.c**, **three.c**, and **four.c**. 

## Submission

- Edit the README.md to add your name to the top of the file
- Submit the URL of your assignment git repository, as provided through GitHub Classroom to D2L.
- Besides the required two required files, **one.c**, **two.c**, **three.c**, and **four.c**, you must not make any changes to 
the existing test files or test script. 
- The last commit to your git repository must be made prior to the deadline of the assignment. Any subsequent commit will not 
be considered.
